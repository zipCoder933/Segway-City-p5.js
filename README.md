# Segway-City-p5.js
A 3D game, using processing core libraries. **Need to convert whats in the "processing original" directory to P5.js for web use**.
The asset files (textures, images, videos, fonts, etc...) are already in the p5.js folder

## Themes
In the segway city game, there are 2 themes. One titled (Adventure), and one titled (Traditional)
The themes are made use as follows:

Game Directory/<br>
|<br>
. . data/<br>
|<br>
. . . **main_theme/, main_theme2/**<br>
  ^ (The 2 folders are the 2 themes. One is Adventure, and the other is Traditional.<br>The directory entitled "main_theme" is the directory that will be used in the game.)
